Analysis on pet product purchase history from a pet product shop

## Company Background
PetMind is a nationwide pet product retailer in the United States. With inflation hitting 41-year
highs, the company is planning to reduce the cost of customer retention by improving brand
loyalty. The first strategy is to launch a monthly pet box subscription in three months.
The marketing team is preparing a list of popular products for the pet box subscription. The
chief marketing officer wants to know whether the list should only include the products being
purchased more than once.
## Customer Questions
The marketing team would like to answer the following questions to help with the decision:
* How many products are being purchased more than once?
* Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?
* What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?
